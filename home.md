Hello, world ☀️

Welcome to my workshop. This site is the counterpart to my other site, [steinea.ca](https://steinea.ca/), which serves as my professional landing page. This site, in comparison, is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/), [memex](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/about.html), or [thought cabinet](https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Thought_Cabinet).

I am a game producer at Electronic Arts, a former game development instructor and current games researcher, a designer and publisher of tabletop games, and an occasional poet. These pages contain my thinking, reading, and writing.

I am located in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia. I work and live on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the Coast Salish nations.
