#### Abstract

The Association for Research in Digital Interactive Narratives (ARDIN), in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University Press, proudly presents the first edition of An Educator’s Guide to Interactive Digital Narrative: Syllabi and Resources from Around the World. This global, transdisciplinary, and continuously evolving collection is dedicated to educators, scholars, and practitioners who teach and develop Interactive Digital Narratives (IDNs) across diverse fields—including storytelling, game development, journalism, AR/VR/XR, digital humanities, and more.

Featuring 45 syllabi from university programs worldwide, this first edition offers a kaleidoscopic view of IDN as it solidifies into a recognized academic discipline. Each syllabus spotlights unique approaches to interactive storytelling, from foundational theories to hands-on best practices. To keep pace with the rapid innovations in industry and academia, new editions will be proposed every five years—ensuring educators always have access to the latest insights, tools, and teaching methodologies.
